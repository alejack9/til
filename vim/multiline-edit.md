# Multiline Edit

Entering in visual block mode (`Ctrl+V`) we can modify the text in multiple positions.

Once we entered in visual block mode and selected multiple lines (using `j`, `k`, `⬆` or `⬇`) we can use:

* `i` to insert a text in selected blocks
* `d` to delete selected text
* `c` or `s` to delete selected text and enter in insert mode
* `R` to delete selected lines and enter in insert mode
* `C` to delete selected lines starting from the cursor and enter in insert mode

This is very usefull to toggle comments in a file!
